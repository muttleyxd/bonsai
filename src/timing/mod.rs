//! Typed runtime intervals for one agent run.
//!
//! A run's wall-clock time mixes work with waiting: model execution, active
//! tool processes, build queues, permission prompts, `question` waits, and
//! child agents. Reporting that single number as "active work" makes a run that
//! spent most of its time waiting on the user look expensive, and it lets queue
//! time hide inside tool failures.
//!
//! [`TimingLedger`] records each interval with its category, lane, owner, and —
//! for waits — a reason. Durations are derived from a monotonic clock so a wall
//! clock adjustment cannot corrupt them, while every interval also carries
//! wall-clock anchors for persistence and audit.
//!
//! Overlap is explicit, not accidental: parallel tool calls and concurrent
//! children each record their own interval, so a summary reports both the
//! *critical path* (the union of all intervals — what the run actually took)
//! and *summed resource time* per category (what the category would have cost
//! serially, which may exceed the critical path).
//!
//! Work and waiting are separated, not only measured: a summary reports the
//! active-compute clock (model, active tool, and child-active time) separately
//! from waiting (queue, permission, user, and child-wait time), and
//! [`TimingPolicy`] records which clock a run's budgets were meant to consume.
//! The policy is persisted and reported per task run; the cumulative session
//! budget still consumes wall time, because changing what stops a run is an
//! enforcement decision tracked separately from recording what it did.
